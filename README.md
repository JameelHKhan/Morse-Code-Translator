# Morse-Code-Translator

Week 5 assignments from Intro to Java at JHU

Skills: Arrays, Strings, Loops

This program translates an English phrase into Morse code or vice versa.  It prompts the user to select which translation to execute (English to Morse or Morse to English) and then asks the user to enter the message to be translated.  For the purposes of this assignment, the inputted English phrase should only be a single sentence (or less) and should not include punctuation symbols. The inputted Morse phrase should have a single space after each letter/digit and a "|" after each word.
